P1

This is my first project in DWA15. It is a web app with information about me and links to my future projects.

I will demo this in sectoin next week.

I had issues with my first setup of Hello World, so I hope this one works.


I referenced these websites mainly for CSS matters:
http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp - inline CSS, wanted to use external but this is a single page
http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp - adjusting image size
http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.en.html - centering images
